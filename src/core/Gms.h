// FL Studio's GMS (Groove Machine Synth) rebuilt as the engine decoded in docs/analise/REA_rodada39.md §1 (clean-room;
// a 1:1 port of our own round-39 reference model r39/py/gmsmodel.py + gmspatch.py, gmsfx.py, gmseq.py, gmsrev.py, which
// was checked against renders of the installation's GMS_x64.dll: 9/9 demo channels within −60 dB).
//
// Per chunk of at most 512 samples: per-voice control values through the MIDI matrix (§1.2–1.4), per-sample envelopes,
// glide, level and modulation (§1.5), three dithered wavetable oscillators + noise per unison slot (§1.6) on 512
// band-limited tables per wave built from the installation's GMS\Synth Waves\<name>.wav (§1.6, read at run time, never
// bundled), the engine-wide LFOs (§1.8), the 4-iteration ladder per voice lane (§1.9), the ten effect slots and the
// output EQ (§1.13) and the master level/pan (§1.12).
//
// The channel keeps the plugin's raw saved state (record 0xD5, "SSLF" + the .gmsynth preset) in ChannelDef::pluginState
// and the folder of the wave files (…\Plugins\Fruity\Generators\GMS\Synth Waves) in ChannelDef::samplePath.
//
// Host interface as FL's wrapper (§1.3, §1.10, §1.11): MIDI velocity from Init.Vol, per-note L/R level tables from
// ComputeLRVol(Final.Pan, Final.Vol) and the pitch-offset table; FL's channel volume/pan/pitch reach GMS only through
// those tables, so LYNX recovers them from its channel gains and does not apply them a second time. The max-polyphony
// event is sent with value 0 (→ 99 voices; FL's value at channel creation is not confirmed, §1.3). Random draws: GMS
// uses one process-global LCG shared by every instance (§1.7); LYNX gives every instance its own generator started like
// a freshly created plugin (state 0, then the constructor's and the rate set's voice resets), so renders are
// deterministic and FL's noise/dither/random phases differ from any given FL render by design.
