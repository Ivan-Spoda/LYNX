// FL Studio's sampler interpolation (REA_rodada69 §1): the read-position interpolators FL's native sampler channels and
// audio clips use (and that FPC, Fruity Slicer and Slicex carry in their own copies): 2-point linear, 6-point
// fifth-order polynomial ("6-point Hermite") and windowed sinc with 16…512 points. Quality = FL's interpolation index
// 1…9 (1 linear, 2 Hermite, 3…9 sinc 16, 24, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 points); FL plays with index 4 (24-point sinc) and
// renders with index 5 (32-point sinc) unless the user changes them. The kernels reproduce FL's arithmetic (x87
// extended precision for the linear/Hermite kernels and the sinc seeds, SSE single precision with the reciprocal
// estimate for the sinc sums), so on the same CPU they give FL's bits; the sine of the seeds comes from the C library.
