// FL Studio's Morphine rebuilt as the engine decoded in docs/analise/REA_rodada39.md §2 (clean-room; a 1:1 port of our
// own round-39 reference model r39/py/mormodel.py + morpatch.py, morfx.py, which was checked against renders of the
// installation's Morphine_x64.dll: 7/7 demo channels within −60 dB).
//
// Per voice, in control blocks of int(0.0029·fs) samples: the modulation processor (Eg1–4 breakpoint envelopes with
// loops, the 12-slot matrix, §2.5), the master ADSR (§2.6), the four generators (keyboard zones, frame player, PWM,
// §2.7) combined through the morph line (§2.8) into a bank of up to 128 coupled-form float oscillators updated every
// third block with a Catmull-Rom amplitude envelope (§2.9), and the noise sample player with its filter (§2.10); then
// the plugin effects overdrive → chorus → delay → reverb → EQ (§2.11) and the master gain (§2.12).
//
// The channel keeps the plugin's raw saved state (record 0xD5, "SSLF" + the Mor0 chunk tree) in ChannelDef::pluginState
// and the full path of the noise sample (…\Plugins\Fruity\Generators\Morphine\Noise Samples\<name>, read at run time
// from the user's installation, never bundled) in ChannelDef::samplePath (empty: no noise).
//
// Host interface as FL's wrapper (§2.3): MIDI velocity from Init.Vol, per-note L/R levels from ComputeLRVol(Final.Pan,
// Final.Vol) and the pitch offset; FL's channel volume/pan/pitch reach Morphine only through those, so LYNX recovers
// them from its channel gains and does not apply them a second time. The max-polyphony event is taken as value 0 (→ 32
// voices; FL's value at channel creation is not confirmed). LYNX creates the instance at the rate it plays at, so the
// sample-rate-change quirks of §2.13 (chorus wet −p⁴, overdrive smoother and master gain jump) do not apply.
